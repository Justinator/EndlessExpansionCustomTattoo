									When getting a high-quality tattoo, there's no cutting corners when it comes to planning. Even if it takes hours or days of research,
									every tattoo is well thought out and designed to form fit to your body.

									It's not only about how your tattoo looks now, but also how your tattoo ages over its entire lifetime. Every tattoo gets planned and
									designed to age well, ensuring you and your artwork look great for years to come.
								</p>
								<p>
									All tattoos are applied by a gentle hand with quick and precise execution. Your tattoo will not only look great, but you'll be as comfortable
									as possible throughout the entire experience.

								Greg is an amazing artist and a pretty stand up dude, I love his style of tattooing and his personality (both very important when getting a tattoo).
								He is also light handed which makes it a little easier to sit through a long session. My first tattoo from him was about 4 years ago and the color
								still looks brand new. I am constantly getting compliments or being asked where I get my tattoos from. I highly recommend Greg if your looking for
								a quality piece of custom artwork!
